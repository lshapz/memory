# Using kyt: An Opinionated Guide

## Installation

We recommend installing kyt as a dependency of your project.

1. Create a repo with a package.json file
2. `npm install --save kyt`
3. `node_modules/.bin/kyt setup` - This will set up your project with all things kyt. Learn more about [setup](/docs/commands.md#setup).
